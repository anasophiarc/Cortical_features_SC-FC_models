# Cortical-features-in-communication-based-SC-FC-models-
Communication models have been used to link brain structure and function by simulating signal propagation across structural connectomes. Previous work has shown that combining multiple communication models within multilinear frameworks can outperform various complex biophysical models in predicting functional connectivity. While these models have been enriched with edge-level biological features, such as edge caliber, cortical-level annotations remain underexplored. In this report, we first investigate whether incorporating MRI-based indices of cortical similarity and excitability into communication-based models can enhance functional connectivity prediction. We evaluate four cortical similarity measures—T1 relaxation time magnetization transfer saturation difference, morphometric similarity, and matching index—and find that adding morphometric similarity and matching index predictors improves prediction accuracy across multiple multilinear models, at both whole-brain and resting-state network levels. We also implement a heterogeneous linear threshold model where node excitability is modulated by T1 relaxation time. While predictive performance remains comparable to a homogeneous model, the linear threshold model approach reveals unexpected structure-function coupling patterns across networks, suggesting it captures a novel signaling dimension warranting further investigation. Together, this exploratory analysis highlights the potential of integrating node-level features into communication-based models of functional connectivity, while underscoring the need for further work, especially in refining the linear threshold model.

This repository includes 2 notebooks: (1) feature_similarity.ipynb which includes code for deriving similarity matrices and implementing multilinear models, and (2) linear_threshold.ipynb which includes the code for a linear threshold model with the option to scale thresholds based on T1 differences.
